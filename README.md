# Draw 3D
This is the mid-term project for the course of 'Programming Practices'.

Mr. Su gave us a lecture about drawing with MFC and asked us to draw a picture of trees, houses and mountains with MFC. Meanwhile, I came up with an idea which was more intriguing and a little bit challenging to me: to draw a picture of trees, houses and mountains in three dimensional and animated manners.

There was one week left for me to complete this project. I managed to implement a perspective system and a simple rendering system in the project and I did most of the coding work within 3 days. Mr. Su seemed delighted with my work.
